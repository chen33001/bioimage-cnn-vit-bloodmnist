# Bioimage Final Project

### Comparative Analysis of CNN and Vision Transformer on BloodMNIST

This site shares the highlights of the Bioimage analysis capstone by **Wei-Fu Chen** (University of Potsdam, 2025).

---

### Overview
CNNs and Vision Transformers capture different patterns in biomedical images. This project compares their **accuracy**, **computational footprint**, and **interpretability** on the BloodMNIST dataset from MedMNIST v2.

---

### Current Status
Model training and comparative analysis are underway. Visual explanations and metrics will be published here once experiments are finalised.
